# Array Creation, Insertion, Deletion, Searching & Sorting 

## Student Queue Management System

This repository contains JavaScript code that simulates a **Student Queue Management System**. It performs essential array operations such as:

- Creation  
- Insertion (from the end)  
- Deletion (from the start)  
- Searching  
- Alphabetical sorting  

#### The array has a **fixed capacity of 10** students. Elements are added only at the end (like a queue) and removed only from the beginning, ensuring a strict **FIFO (First In, First Out)** behavior.
